Pywal is used to generate a color scheme from a wallpaper which is then also set as the lockscreen background.
This color scheme is then automatically applied to the terminal, ranger, dunst, vim and i3 making it quick and easy to generate a fresh setup.


#### zsh

I use the Z shell with [Oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) and the zsh prompt [spaceship](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt).\
ZSH can be set by entering the command below in the terminal.

```
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```


#### TODO

+ Add an install script
